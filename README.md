# Assignment5
This assignment entails developing a comprehensive system for a fashion retailer, starting with image annotation and database setup using OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API. By generating fashion image tags, creating a JSON template, and utilizing ChatGPT for efficient data creation, an automation script is implemented to annotate images and perform bulk upserts into a Snowflake database. The second part involves enhancing a multi-modal retrieval model, to find similar images and text tags given an image or text description. The final phase focuses on building a Streamlit app to serve as an intuitive interface for users to upload images or input text descriptions, facilitating seamless interaction with the multi-modal retrieval model

## Usage/Steps:
- Open the terminal and clone this repo or use GitHub Desktop, Upload these notebooks on google colab or you can run locally as well.
- set up the Amazon AWS account to generate S3 keys and tokens.
- Set up environment variables for API keys and Snowflake connection.
- Run the annotation script as per the provided instructions.
- Install all the requirements and run the streamlit application.
